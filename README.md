# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Arduino
The project predicts the possibility of rainfall in a area by analysing the amount of light received,the humidity and the
temperature in an area.
In addition to that it also displays the probability of rainfall ,temperature, humidity and the light intensity received in a 
16X2 LCD display.
All codes have been implemented in Arduino UNO and DHT and LiquidCrystal libraries have been used.
